Dotfiles for mac
- A few custom scripts for Yabai, Hammerspoon
- Sketchybar copied from neutonfoo

TO-DO List:

Yabai:
- Implement functionality to switch to simpler logic when using a single screen
- for yabai window transparency fix moving windows on multiple displays

Hammerspoon:
- Hotkeys for moving windows to other monitors (make sure they're only active when other monitors exist)
- focused app on display changes. I'm currently unsure of desired behavior if app does not exist on the focused screen
- More Hotkeys

Sketchybar:
- I need to learn more about this app before I have a true todo list but
- Multiple timezone clocks with intelligent switching/adding/removing
- icons for current app
