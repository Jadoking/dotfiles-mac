# Multi-Display Version that mostly works
# Current issues 
# - When moving windows to another display the contents on the starting and ending monitor don't change
#   This is most apparent when moving a window with transparency as the invisible window below does not promote
#   and the top window on the new display doesn't dim. attempted something with window moved event
#   but I haven't been able to figure out how to be aware of the next item in the stack
#   I'm currently unsure if yabai even has awareness of what is below focus in the stack before its promoted to focus
#   current way to fix it is to move your mouse off to the original screen and back to trigger focus events
# TODO: Figure out above issue
# NOTES: 
# - Window moved triggers on every frame where the window is being moved.
#   While I don't think it affects how the fix would work its important to consider that the event is
#   firing many times while being dragged. Could be fixed by some sort of debounce, however, it would
#   potentially be an issue if you drag break for a second, drag break for a second. Increasing debounce
#   times to too long could make things look laggy
# - Above can be dealt with using hotkeys to move windows to seperate displays. This is my preferred method
#   of moving windows but I wanted to deal with all edge cases.
# - It's possible that rather than using yabai hammerspoon could have some form of implementation to deal with this
# - It's likely that I will need to implement some form of delay for the floating window to be introduced to the top layer
# - I am not sure if above is how it works
